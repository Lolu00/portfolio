# Portfolio Enhancement TODO

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Adjust grid to consistently display 3 columns (col-lg-4) for better image accommodation
- [x] Add images to all project cards that were missing them using available saved images
- [x] Ensure uniform image sizing (200px height, object-fit: cover) with rounded corners
- [x] Maintain aesthetic enhancements (improved shadows, spacing, hover effects via project-card class)
- [x] Expand each project to cover full width of the system using col-12
- [x] Make projects responsive with horizontal card layout (image left, content right)

## Summary
- Updated portfolio.html to include images for all 17 projects
